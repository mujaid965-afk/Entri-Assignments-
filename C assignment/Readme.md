## C Assignment Questions 
BASIC REFRESHER 
1. Write a C program that takes an integer from the user and determines whether 
the number is even or odd. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a whole number. It must 
then check if the number is perfectly divisible by 2. If it is, the program should 
display that the number is even; otherwise, it should display that the number is odd. 
The program should handle both positive and negative integers. 
Pre-requisites: Conditional Statements, Operators.

3. Write a C program that asks the user to enter a number and determines whether that 
number is prime or not. 
Description: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be 
formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. In simpler terms, it is a number 
that is only divisible by 1 and itself. Your program should take an integer as input and 
check if it has any divisors other than 1 and the number itself. If the user enters a 
number like 2, 3, or 5, the program should identify it as prime. However, if the user 
enters a number less than 2, or a number like 4 or 6 that can be divided by other 
values, the program should state it is not prime. You should use a simple loop to test 
for these divisors and a conditional statement to print the final result. 
Pre-requisites: Loops, Conditional Statements, Operators 
4. Write a C program that takes a positive integer from the user and calculates its 
factorial. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a single whole number. It 
must then calculate the factorial of that number, which is the product of all positive 
integers from 1 up to the number entered. The final result should be displayed clearly 
on the screen. The program should also account for the fact that the factorial of 0 is 
Pre-requisites: Operators, Data Types, Loops. 
5. Write a C program to generate the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter the number of terms (n). It 
should then generate the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the 
two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The program must display the sequence up 
to the specified number of terms. 
Pre-requisites: Loops, Variables, Basic Arithmetic Operations 
Functions 
6.  Write a C program that uses a function to check whether a given number is a 
Perfect Number. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a positive integer. A 
separate function must be written that computes the sum of all proper divisors of the 
number (excluding the number itself) and returns whether the sum equals the original 
number. The main function should display whether the number is perfect or not. 
(Example: 6 = 1+2+3, 28 = 1+2+4+7+14) 
Pre-requisites: Functions, Loops, Return Values. 
7. Write a C program that uses a recursive function to find the GCD of two 
numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter two positive integers. A 
recursive function must be written that repeatedly applies the Euclidean method  
replacing the larger number with the remainder of dividing the two until the 
remainder is zero. The GCD should be returned to the main function and displayed on 
the screen. 
Pre-requisites: Functions, Recursion, Modulus Operator. 
8. Write a C program that uses a function to count the frequency of each digit (0–9) 
in a given integer. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter an integer. A separate 
function must be written that takes the number, extracts each digit using a loop, and 
updates a frequency array accordingly. The function should not return a single value 
but instead update the array directly. The main function should then print how many 
times each digit appears in the number. 
Pre-requisites: Functions, Arrays, Loops, Pass by Reference (Pointers). 
9. Write a C program that uses functions to convert a decimal number to any base 
between 2 and 16. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a decimal number and a 
target base. A separate function must be written that performs the repeated division 
method, stores each remainder, and builds the result in the correct order. For bases 
above 9, remainders 10–15 should be represented as letters A–F. The converted value 
should be displayed from the main function. 
Pre-requisites: Functions, Loops, Arrays, Character Handling. 
10. Write a C program that uses functions to evaluate a simple arithmetic expression 
given two numbers and an operator. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter two floating-point 
numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /). A separate function must be written for 
each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). A selector function should take the 
operator as a parameter and call the appropriate function, returning the result to main. 
Division by zero must be handled gracefully inside the divide function. 
Pre-requisites: Functions, Switch/Conditionals, Float Arithmetic, Error Handling. 
STRINGS 
11. Write a C program that takes a string of digits from the user and converts it into its equivalent 
integer value. 
Description:The program should prompt the user to enter a number as a string (for example, 
"1234"). It must then process this string character by character and transform it into an actual 
integer variable that can be used for mathematical operations. The program should be able to 
handle positive numbers and display the final integer result on the screen. 
Pre-requisites: Loops, Strings, Operators. 
12. Write a C program that takes an integer from the user and converts it into a 
string of characters. 
Description:The program should prompt the user to enter a whole number. It must 
then process this integer and store each of its digits as characters within a character 
array (string). The resulting string should represent the number exactly as it was 
entered, including a negative sign if the number is less than zero. Finally, the program 
should display the resulting string on the screen. 
Pre-requisites: Strings, Loops, Operators. 
13. Write a C program that takes a string from the user and checks whether it is a 
palindrome. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a string. It must determine 
if the string reads the same forward and backward. The program should then display a 
message to the user stating whether the input is a palindrome or not. 
Pre-requisites: Loops, Control Statements, Strings and Operators. 
14. Write a C program that takes a string from the user and reverses its characters using 
an iterative approach. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a sequence of characters. It 
must then swap or move the characters within the string using a loop until the entire 
string is reversed. The final resulting string should be displayed on the screen. 
Pre-requisites: Loops, Strings. Operators. 
15.  Write a C program that takes a string input from the user and determines whether it is 
a pangram or not. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a sentence or a string of 
characters. It must then verify if every letter of the alphabet from A to Z appears at 
least once within the provided text, regardless of whether the letters are uppercase or 
lowercase. The final output should state if the string is a pangram. 
Pre-requisites: Loops, Strings, Conditional Statements, ASCII, Operators 
16.  Write a C program that takes a string from the user and replaces every sequence of 
multiple consecutive spaces with a single space. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a sentence that may 
contain several spaces between words. It must then process the string to ensure that 
any instance where two or more blank spaces appear together is reduced to just one 
blank space. The final cleaned string should be displayed on the screen. 
Pre-requisites:  Loops, Strings, Conditional Statements, ASCII, Operators 
17.  Write a C program that takes a string from the user and converts all uppercase letters 
into their corresponding lowercase letters. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a sequence of characters. It 
must then check each character individually. If a character is an uppercase letter, the 
program should convert it to its lowercase equivalent. If the character is already 
lowercase or is not a letter at all, the program should leave it exactly as it is. The final 
modified string should be displayed on the screen. 
Pre-requisites: Loops, Strings, Conditional Statements, ACII. 
Bit Manipulation 
18.  Write a C program that takes a number and toggles a specific number of bits (n) 
starting from a given position. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter an integer, a starting bit 
position, and the number of bits to be modified. It must then change the state of those 
(n)  consecutive bits—switching 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s—while keeping all other bits in 
the number exactly as they were. The final value of the number after the toggle 
operation should be displayed on the screen. 
Pre-requisites: Bitwise operators, Loops, Assignment operators. 
19. Write a C program that takes an integer from the user and extracts (n) bits starting 
from a specific bit position. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a number, a starting 
position, and the number of bits to be retrieved. It must then isolate that specific 
sequence of bits from the original value and display the resulting number on the 
screen. The other bits in the number should not affect the final output. 
Pre-requisites: Bitwise Operators. 
20.  Write a C program that takes a number and replaces n of its bits, starting from a 
given position, with another set of n bits from a second number. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter two integers, a starting bit 
position, and the number of bits n to be modified. It must then clear $n$ bits in the 
first number at the specified position and replace them with the corresponding $n$ 
bits from the second number. The final resulting value should be displayed on the 
screen while all other bits in the first number remain unchanged. 
Pre-requisites: Bitwise Operators 
21. Write a C program that takes two integers and swaps n bits starting from a given 
position in both numbers. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter two integers, a starting bit 
position, and the number of bits (n) to be swapped. It must then exchange the n 
consecutive bits at the specified position between the two numbers — the bits from 
the first number go into the second, and vice versa — while all remaining bits in both 
numbers stay exactly as they were. Both final values should be displayed on the 
screen after the swap. 
Pre-requisites: Bitwise Operators, Loops, Assignment Operators. 
Array 
22. Write a C program to remove duplicate elements from a given array. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter the size of the array and its 
elements. It must then identify and remove any duplicate values, ensuring that each 
element appears only once in the resulting array. The program should finally display 
the updated array containing only unique elements. 
Pre-requisites: Arrays, Loops, Conditional Statements 
23. Write a C program that uses an array to find the second largest and second 
smallest element in a list of numbers. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter the size of the array and its 
elements. It must then scan through the array and determine both the second largest 
and second smallest values without sorting the array. The program should handle 
duplicate values correctly — if all elements are the same, it should display an 
appropriate message. Both results should be displayed on the screen. 
Pre-requisites: Arrays, Loops, Conditional Statements. 
24. Write a C program that rotates the elements of an array by n positions in a 
specified direction. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter the array elements, the 
number of positions (n) to rotate, and the direction (left or right). It must then shift the 
elements accordingly — elements that fall off one end should reappear at the opposite 
end. The rotation must work for any value of n, including values larger than the array 
size. The final rotated array should be displayed on the screen. 
Pre-requisites: Arrays, Loops, Modulus Operator. 
25. Write a C program that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array 
without using any sorting function. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter the sizes and elements of 
two arrays, each already sorted in ascending order. It must then merge them into a 
third array by comparing elements from both arrays one by one and placing the 
smaller element first, continuing until all elements are placed. The final merged sorted 
array should be displayed on the screen. 
Pre-requisites: Arrays, Loops, Multiple Array Handling. 
26. Write a C program that finds all pairs of elements in an array whose sum equals 
a given target value. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter the size of the array, its 
elements, and a target sum. It must then examine all possible pairs of elements in the 
array and identify every pair whose sum matches the target. Each valid pair should be 
printed on the screen. If no such pair exists, an appropriate message should be 
displayed. The same element should not be paired with itself. 
Pre-requisites: Arrays, Nested Loops, Conditional Statements.

appear before all positive numbers while preserving the relative order of both 
groups. 
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter the size of the array and its 
elements (a mix of positive and negative integers). It must then rearrange the elements 
so that all negative numbers come first, followed by all positive numbers, without 
changing the order in which the negatives appear among themselves or the positives 
among themselves. Zero can be treated as positive. The rearranged array should be 
displayed on the screen. 
Pre-requisites: Arrays, Loops, Temporary Storage, Order Preservation Logic. 
Structure 
28. Define a structure Complex with real and imaginary parts. Write a C program to add 
two complex numbers and display the result. 
Description: The program should define a structure to represent a complex number 
with two members: real part and imaginary part. It must then create functions to 
perform addition of two complex numbers and to display a complex number in a 
readable format (e.g., a + bi). The program should take input for two complex 
numbers, compute their sum using the defined function, and print the result.
